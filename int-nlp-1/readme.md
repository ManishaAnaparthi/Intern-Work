**Natural Language Processing

_Language is a method of communication with the help of which we can speak, read and
write. For example, we think, we make decisions, plans and more in natural language;
precisely, in words. However, the big question that confronts us in this AI era is that can
we communicate in a similar manner with computers. In other words, can human beings
communicate with computers in their natural language? It is a challenge for us to develop
NLP applications because computers need structured data, but human speech is
unstructured and often ambiguous in nature.
In this sense, we can say that Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the sub-field of
Computer Science especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is concerned about enabling
computers to understand and process human language. Technically, the main task of NLP
would be to program computers for analyzing and processing huge amount of natural
language data.
